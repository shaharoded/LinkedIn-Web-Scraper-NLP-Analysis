# LinkedIn-Web-Scraper-NLP-Analysis
In this project my purpose was to create a web scraper on LinkedIn job posts that can scrape common skills demanded for certain jobs.

The input of the scraper is the initial LinkedIn web page of the search query (for example - Sales positions in the USA).

Using Threadpools and MultiThreaded process, an initial data frame is scraped.

The first analysis uses a wordcloud on top of an NLTK analysis of the job descriptions.

The second analysis uses GPT API to accurately extract the skills from the job descriptions
